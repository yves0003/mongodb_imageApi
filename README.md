# Create your own Image API

This repository is a good starting point to create an Image collection where
everyone can contribute and access it through an API.

the tools i use to create this repository are:

- Next.js for the front end
- Cloudinary to save the file (even if you can save file string directly in
  mongoDB)
- MongoDb to save all the links and create an API

If you want you can disabled the cloudinary part and save the image string
directly (your choice!!!).

For this example, i choosed to create an API for cryptocurrency logo. But you
can imagine something like this for:

- holidays where you replace in the code the input text by an input file
- Seminar

## Where to start

\
 Go to my github account and clone.

credentials

    COLLECTION_DATASTRING=XXXXX
    COLLECTION_LINKURL=XXXXXX
    DATABASE_MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://xxxxx
    DATABASE_MONGO_NAME=database_name

\
 if you decide to use cloudinary (**_if not : Do not forget to modify the
code_**)

    CLOUDINARY_NAME=XXXXXX
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=XXXXXX
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=XXXXXX

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Idea: If you are a big fan of cryptocurrency, you can save these files using
the [Permaweb - Arweave project](https://www.arweave.org/) with ArDrive :) and let
the data available forever. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
